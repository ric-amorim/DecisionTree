# Decision Tree (ID3 algorithm)

   (This project was made for the artificial intelligence curricular unit)

## About the project

Decision Trees are non-parameterized supervised algorithms used for classification and regression procedures. It is composed of a system of nodes representing tests on attributes, edges representing the possible outcomes of the same tests, and leaves representing the output values. The tree's hierarchical structure allows sequential decisions to be made, following the paths determined by the tests at each node.<br />



## How to use the code:

   1- compile the files (javac *.java)<br />
   2- use $ java ID32<br />
   3- write the name of the file e.g. "restaurant.csv <br />
   4- tell it if you want to create a new example<br /> 
   5- write the new example without the class, <br />
        example restaurant.csv : "X13,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Full,$,No,No,Burger,30-60,Yes"<br />
<br />
<br />
The libraries used were all from java.util
